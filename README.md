# DICOM-Using-Python

If you are a **Biomedical Engineer**, an **IT Specialist in the healthcare field**, or a **Healthcare Data Scientist/Analyst**, you’ve probably used or at least heard about DICOM because it’s everywhere related to medical imaging systems. DICOM is a set of standards that are created to allow communication across multiple modalities between multiple manufacturers so that all medical machines, that are DICOM-compliant of course, can speak the same language when sending information across a network. All you need is one piece of software, a DICOM reader, to read many medical DICOM images from many different modalities.

For more information about **DICOM**, refer to this **[post](https://medium.com/@omar.ok1998/what-is-dicom-a28c5fe24c9d)**.

## Dealing with DICOM using Python PartI: [[Code]](https://github.com/OmarAlkousa/DICOM-Using-Python/blob/main/Dealing%20with%20DICOM%20using%20Python%20PartI/Dealing_with_DICOM_using_Python_%20PartI.ipynb)
We will use the **ImageIO** Python package to **read DICOM files**, **extract metadata** and attributes, and plot image slices using **interactive** slider widgets. While doing so, we have to understand some important DICOM attributes such as **Pixel Spacing**, **Shape**, **Slice Thickness**, and **Aspect Ratio**.
